# Hack4Resillience-Bacoat-Procons-
This program is a part of Bacoat team participation in Hack4Resillience 2020 event. 
Unrar / Unizip the folder and use IDLE to open and run script. The script and database is located in 'Bacoat Procons' folder

~~~~ What's behind the team name and program name? ~~~~~
Bacoat is a team originating from Indonesia, with a mission to provide solutions to deal with food loss and waste which happens worldwide. 
The team is made of postharvest engineering students and graduate. 

Procons stands from the word Production and Consumption mixed together. 
The program relies on simplicity of the database, which contains no more data variables than Period, Production (in Tons) and Consumption (in Tons).

~~~~ What this program does? ~~~~~
This is a simple program to analyze a database of production and consumption data of commodities such as fruits and vegetables. 
Over-supply and over-demand are some recurring problems in fresh produce supply chains. 
Lack of information bridge between producers and end-consumers causes serious gap between actual need and commodities in circulation. 
The result is always catastrophic: massive ammount of food loss and waste, including price fluctuation in the market.

If somehow the information bridge can be solved, stakeholders responsible for regulating supply chains can make decisions based on the analysis (provided if the data is updated in monthly basis instead of years). 
Food loss and waste can be somehow mitigated and market price will have slighter fluctuation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ATTENTION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The database included in the pre-cooked WinPython Procons is only mock-up. 

To analyze relevant data from Indonesia 2013-2014 :
Replace the procons_database.xlsx using the file of same name in Releases or Repository.
